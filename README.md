Tools to work with data from Jigsaw

These are functions in R to read in data from Jigsaw and create analysis data sets.  There are some data cleaning tools as well, and a very basic version of some functions to create a "Table 1".  This repository will be updated as Jigsaw matures to facilitate analyses of observational data.  We will leave this open to the public in case anything is helpful, but this will be primarily for internal purposes at Outcomes Insights, Inc.
