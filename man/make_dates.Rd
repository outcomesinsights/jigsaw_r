\title{Converts Variable to Date Type}
\usage{
make_dates(dt = NULL, dd = data_dict)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{The data table in which to convert date columns}

\item{dd}{The data dictionary with variable types to identify date columns}
}
\value{
Variable(s) converted to an R date class
}
\description{
Converts all date columns to date format (in place via data.table).  Uses the data.table IDate class
which his much faster than the base as.Date() function.  IDate is still recognized as an R
date class.  Note that this function needs to be improved to take advantage of
attributes or classes.  This is intended to run as part of load_data().
